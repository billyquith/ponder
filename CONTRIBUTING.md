Hi, if you have found a bug, or would like to comment or extend an example then you will find this
document useful.


### Reporting bugs

Obviously, please try and read the [documentation][doc], and examples first. If you are getting
unexpected behaviour then please visit the [issues][i] page. Check existing issues first, and if
you can't find your problem, open a new issue. Code samples very welcome when describing bugs.


### Submitting code

I'm largely following the [gitflow][gf] workflow.

Tips & rules:

- It is best to open an issue and discuss the change before making it. This will act as 
  partial documentation for the change.  
- It would be appreciated if you could patch the `develop` branch; your changes may need testing,
  refactoring, or documentation, before being released. Your bug may also be fixed there.
- If you are going a *pull request* then please create a feature branch before committing your
  changes.  
- All the tests need to pass before anything is pulled. You'll be able to see this in
  you PR. There are tests for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. All need to pass.

Thanks,
BQ
